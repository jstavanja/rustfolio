# Rustfolio

## What?
Simple portfolio CMS, that has a simple backend, and a non-styled front end,
which one can style in a million ways (completely up to your imagination).
Basically started as a fun project, to try and learn a little bit of Rust and
train my Vue skills.

## Why is it good for me?
I try to keep the front end of the actual site filled with the content
powered by the CMS as clean as possible, so everyone can style their portfolio
as they wish and build the components however they want. I also try and keep
the dashboard design simple.

## Why doesn't it compile?
Rustfolio's backend is made using the Rocket library, which requires the nightly
build of Rust. Try installing that and retry.
